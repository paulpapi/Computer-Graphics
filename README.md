# C++ Computer Graphics Implementations 🎨🚀

Welcome to **paulpapi's** repository for **C++ Computer Graphics**! This collection showcases various implementations of rendering techniques, transformations, and visual effects using OpenGL and other graphics libraries.

## 📌 Overview
This repository focuses on fundamental and advanced graphics programming concepts, including:
- **Basic Rendering** – Drawing shapes, handling colors, and rendering pixels.
- **Geometric Transformations** – Scaling, rotating, and translating objects.
- **Shading & Lighting** – Implementing shaders for visual effects.
- **3D Graphics** – Projection techniques and camera movements.

## 🔍 Implemented Graphics Techniques
### **1. Basic Rendering**
- Drawing lines, triangles, and polygons using OpenGL.
- Handling color manipulation and rasterization.

### **2. Geometric Transformations**
- Scaling, rotation, and translation matrices.
- Affine transformations for object manipulation.

### **3. Shaders & Visual Effects**
- Vertex and fragment shaders using GLSL.
- Texture mapping and lighting calculations.

### **4. 3D Graphics & Camera**
- Implementing perspective and orthographic projections.
- Using `gluLookAt()` for camera positioning.

### **5. Advanced Graphics Features**
- Clipping algorithms for viewport control.
- Pseudo-color processing for scientific visualization.
